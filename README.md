# Sierpiński triangle
The Sierpiński triangle, also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets—that is, it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpiński.

#### The Sierpinski triangle may be constructed from an equilateral triangle by repeated removal of triangular subsets:
    
    1. Start with an equilateral triangle.
    2. Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove the central triangle.
    3. Repeat step 2 with each of the remaining smaller triangles infinitely.
